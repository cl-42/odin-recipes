            <li>1/4 cup toasted and chopped hazelnuts</li>
            <li>Handful of fresh mint, chopped</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pan-Seared Scallops</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>8 large sea Scallops, cleaned</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt and fresh cracked pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Lemon juice, to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul></div>

        <div class="steps"><h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425˚F and line a roasting pan with foil.</li>
            <li>Prepare squash for puree - place squash halves on a baking sheet and divide butter, herbs, and garlic amongst each half.
            Season generously with salt and pepper and olive oil, roast until tender for about 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Once squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out flesh (including garlic) and place in a blender along with roasted
            garlic, discarding herbs. Pulse until smooth, season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Prepare vinaigrette - in a small bowl, whisk together quince paste and 1 tablespoon hot water until smooth. Whisk in
            shallot, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil until smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare slaw - toss together cabbages, pomegranate seeds, hazelnuts, and mint. Zest lemon over the slaw and toss with
            enough vinaigrette to coat, being careful to not over dress.</li>
            <li>Prepare scallops - Heat a skillet over high heat. Find the wide “top” side of the scallops and place facing up on a
            plate lined with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle hot pan with oil and sear scallops until golden and
            caramelized. Flip scallops and juice half a lemon over scallops, swirl in a few knobs of butter and let brown, finish
            with remaining lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>To serve - divide warmed squash puree amongst plates (or shallow bowls) and nestle scallops on top, garnishing with
            pomegranate-quince slaw and a drizzle of quince vinaigrette, serve immediately.</li>
