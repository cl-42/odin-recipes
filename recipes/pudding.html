            <p>Sticky toffee puddings, Gordon Ramsay's favourite dessert which features a moist sponge cake made with finely
                chopped dates, covered in toffee
                sauce and often served with vanilla custard or ice-cream.

        <div class="steps"><h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the Pudding: Place the dates and baking soda in a heat-proof bowl or measuring cup. Pour boiling water over and
            press the dates down with a spoon so they're submerged. Let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (alternatively, a large bowl and a hand mixer), cream
            butter and sugar on high until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to medium, add the egg and continue to mix
            until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low, add flour and baking powder and
            mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350˚F (175˚C).</li>
            <li>Puree the dates using a blender or immersion blender. Pour the mixture directly into the bowl of the stand mixer mix on
            low until well combined.</li>
            <li>Grease and flour a 6-cup muffin tin. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cavities and place in the oven. Bake
            for 17-19 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. Allow the cakes to cool for about 5
            minutes before turning out onto a plate or tray.</li>
            <li>While the cakes are baking, make the Toffee Sauce: combine all ingredients (except bourbon) in a small saucepan. Bring
            to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar, and boil for 3 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat, stir
            in bourbon, and allow to cool slightly before spooning over the puddings. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="Note"><strong>Recipe Note</strong>:A standard 12-cup muffin tin can of course be used, simply grease and flour only 6 of the cavities. The recipe also
        easily doubles to make 12 puddings.</p></div></div>
